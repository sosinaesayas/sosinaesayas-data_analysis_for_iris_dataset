# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, focusing on the relationships between different flower attributes, including `petal_length`, `petal_width`, and `species`. The goal is to analyze the data distribution and visualize relationships using various univariate and multivariate plots.

## About the Project
The EDA is implemented using Python, leveraging the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to generate visualizations. This project aims to help understand the statistical properties of the Iris dataset and explore relationships between features. It includes:
- Histograms for univariate analysis of `petal_length` and `petal_width`.
- Scatter plots for exploring relationships between `petal_length`, `petal_width`, and `species`.

### Visualizations
1. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Histograms show the distribution of `petal_length` and `petal_width`.
   
2. **Multivariate Analysis**:
   - Scatter plots between `petal_length` and `petal_width`.
   - Scatter plots between `petal_length`, `petal_width`, and `species`.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which contains information about the petal and sepal dimensions of three different species of Iris flowers.

| Feature        | Description                  |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| `petal_length` | Length of the petals         |
| `petal_width`  | Width of the petals          |
| `species`      | Species of the Iris flower   |
